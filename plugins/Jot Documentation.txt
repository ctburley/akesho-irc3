Akesho's jot module is used to store information for later recall.
The character currently in use is a dash/hyphen/minux sign '-'.
To store information use this character, a key for retrieval,
and the value you wish to store.
    <you> -key = value

A key can be deleted. Use a minus '-' after the command character.
Currently Ops (@) only.
    <@you> --key

To recall information you use the command character and the key.
    <you> -key
    <bot> nick: value

This response from the bot can be targeted at another user.
    <you> -key @ user

A value can be stored to respond without prepending 'nickname: '.
    <you> -key == value
    <you> -key
    <bot> value

Keys are alphanumeric, and may contain spaces. Values may contain anything.
    <you> -simple keys are easy to remember = Values can be more complex; and, can contain colors, formatting, and URLs.

A Key=>Value pair, henceforth a 'jot', can be saved locally or globally.
Saving a jot globally allows it to be accessed from all channels. Local
jots take priority over global, so you will see that jot instead of the
globally stored one. Only channel operators may currently save global jots.
    local:
        <you> -key = value
    global:
        <@you> -key -g = value

A jot can have more than one value, and will return one at random. Adding values
to an existing jot is like adding a jot, but use a pipe character '|' before the equals '='.
    <you> -key = value1
    <you> -key |= value2
    <you> -key |= value3
    
You can recall a specific value from such a jot. See how many values it has
by using '#' after the command character. You can use the index of the value
you want with a period '.' after the key name like this:
    <you> -#key
    <bot> 'key' has 3 values.
    <you> -key.2
    <bot> you: value3
Remember that arrays start at zero!

You can edit jots instead of deleting and re-setting them.
Currently Ops (@) Only.

To add 'data' to the end of a value:
    <@you> -key +=data
To remove 'data' from anywhere within a value:
    <@you> -key -=data
To search for 'needle' and replace with 'data':
    <@you> -key ~needle=data

There is a basic search function to look for keys, use a question mark
after the command character and your search term.
    <you> -?hel
    <bot> -help  -game help  -help cats are eating my eyes

Channel operators who have recently stored information they do not
wish to lose may force the bot to save sooner than its timed five minute intervals.
This requires a double command character and the word save:
    <@you> --save



Cheat sheet:
 add:            -key [-g] = value
@remove:         --key
 recall:         -key [-g]
 tell:           -key @ target
 add literal:    -key [-g] == value
 another value:  -key [-g] |= value
 count:          -#key [-g]
 specific value: -key.0 [-g]
@suppliment:     -key[.0] [-g] +=value
@subtract:       -key[.0] [-g] -=value
@search&replace: -key[.0] [-g] ~search=replace
 search keys:    -?term
@force save:     --save
